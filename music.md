      Kevinâ€™s work as a DJ is tellingly influenced by the smooth jazz he grew up listening to. The bassline never strays far from his selections. Witnessing a KJH set entails a movement of body and soul from mood-setting jams to upbeat soul, funk, disco, and house. Maybe a little sax here and there too.

      As an avid record collector, his vinyl collection ranges from left-field grooves to feel good hits. You can find him holding down Silk &amp; Soul at Punch House on second Wednesdays, as well various nights at his favorite spots in Chicago.
