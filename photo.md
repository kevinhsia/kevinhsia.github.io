      Kevin started shooting with his dad's Nikon film camera in the Summer of 2007—the rest is history. He founded VAMP (Vintage Analog Manual Photographers), a student organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Since graduating, current students and alum continue the film tradition.
